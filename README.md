Calculator Website

Hi, I'm Sukhjit. I developed this calculator with the help of ChatGPT. The objective of this project was to create a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is primarily for educational purposes.

Features

Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Works across a variety of devices including PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. However, it may have display issues on smaller screens.


Known Issues

There are some inconsistencies in the calculator, such as the ability to input operations like + and - simultaneously. This is not mathematically correct, and I plan to address it in future updates.

Compatibility

The website is designed to work on most modern devices, but it may not display properly on very small screens.

Thank you for visiting and using my calculator!
